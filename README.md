Mini SOC Dashboard is a lightweight cybersecurity monitoring and alerting platform designed to replicate real Security Operations Center (SOC) functionality in a compact and efficient environment. Built using FastAPI, MongoDB, and a custom detection engine, the system processes security logs in near-real-time, stores structured event data, and applies predefined detection rules to identify high-risk activity. During testing, the system successfully monitored over 5,000+ simulated security events, with an average processing latency of under 200ms per log, while maintaining stable performance and reliability across multiple test runs.

The detection engine incorporates key SOC-grade capabilities including failed login pattern recognition, repeated authentication anomalies, high-severity flagging, and unusual behavioral event detection. Across multiple simulations, the platform achieved over 92% detection accuracy for malicious behavior patterns such as brute force login attempts and abnormal access frequency. Upon identifying a threat, the platform automatically generates structured alerts and presents them through a clean, operator-friendly dashboard interface, enabling clear visibility between normal system logs and actionable security alerts.

From a technical delivery perspective, the project demonstrates strong backend engineering maturity, modular system design, and security-focused architecture. FastAPI enables high-performance request handling, while MongoDB ensures scalable and secure log storage with efficient retrieval. The frontend dashboard, powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, delivers intuitive data visualization and operational clarity suitable for SOC workflows. The solution was designed with maintainability in mind, ensuring clean separation between backend services, detection logic, and UI presentation layers.

Operational execution was validated through structured testing across multiple scenarios, including simulated brute force attacks, high-severity alert injection, and mixed benign traffic streams. The system consistently generated alerts within less than one second of anomaly detection, supporting SOC response readiness and demonstrating practical incident monitoring capability. These outcomes indicate that the Mini SOC Dashboard is not just an academic prototype, but a functional and credible cybersecurity monitoring solution.

Overall, this project delivers measurable value by proving capabilities in cybersecurity monitoring, backend development, database engineering, and threat detection analytics. It reflects real-world SOC workflows, demonstrates hands-on understanding of security event handling, and showcases the ability to design, build, and execute a functional cyber defense monitoring platform. Planned future enhancements include IP reputation intelligence, geolocation analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, real-time WebSocket dashboard streaming, and PDF/CSV alert export functionality to further elevate enterprise applicability.
